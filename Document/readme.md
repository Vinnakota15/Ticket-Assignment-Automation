 Streamlining Ticket Assignment for Efficient Support Operations

Abstract:-
This project automates the support ticket assignment process in **ABC Corporation** using **ServiceNow**. The aim is to minimize manual intervention, reduce delays, and enhance overall operational performance.

Objective:-
To implement an automated ticket routing system that ensures each support issue is quickly directed to the appropriate team based on predefined criteria.

Methodology:-

- Created **users**, **roles**, and **groups** in ServiceNow
- Assigned users to appropriate groups and assigned roles to group members
- Applied **role-based access** for required tables through **ACLs**
- Built an automated ticket routing **Flow** using **Flow Designer**

Tools & Technologies:-

- **ServiceNow**
- **Flow Designer**
- **ACL (Access Control List) Configuration**
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**

Results:-

-  Reduced ticket assignment time from minutes to seconds  
-  Improved ticket response and resolution rate  
- üëÅ Enhanced visibility and control over ticketing operations  
-  Prevented unauthorized access through proper ACLs

Future Scope:-

- Expand ticket routing rules for more **granular team assignment**
- Integrate **AI-based suggestions** for better routing predictions
- Add **escalation logic** for tickets that remain unassigned or unresolved
